Grayscale Filtering is an Android application developed by Jimmy Bao. It allows users to alter the image by applying a filter based on the user's touch. Other features that I implemented because I thought it would improve the overall usability of the app:

- Being able to select an image from the Gallery
- Option of either using the "Grayscale" or the "Bright" filters
- Option of saving the altered image into the Gallery
