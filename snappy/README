SnapPY README

1) You must be running Python 3
2) Go into the /visualizer directory and run "python snappy_server.py" 
3) Leave the server running and open a new tab
4) Change the path to the /ui directory and run "python -m http.server"
5) Enter "localhost:8000" into your browser and the UI should be running


Currently, SnapPY only supports a subset of Python code. It lacks the support for 
exception handling, nested data structures and complex data structures (i.e. trees
and graphs), and objects and classes. 


Here is a YouTube video demonstrating how SnapPY should work:
