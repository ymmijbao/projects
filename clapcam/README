- Supports both front-facing and rear-facing cameras 
- Supports both portrait and landscape mode
- Always listening for claps right when the app is launched so the user doesn't have to toggle any buttons
- Allows for sharing with friends via any other apps that support images natively from the application
- A clapping icon that tells the user when the application has picked up on a clap so the user can clearly
tell when/if the application hears the clap
